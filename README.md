# Arduino-Projects
A collection of scripts that I have made for experementing with various componenets and circuits, including controlling LED's, LCD displays to display messages, as well as using chips such as H-bridges to control electric motors and their direction of spin at variable speeds (note I have also included code which displays amount of power being applied, by lighting up a series of leds in sequence).
